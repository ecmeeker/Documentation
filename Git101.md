# Tutorial for the Command Line:
* Install (offline): https://git-scm.com/download/win 
* Verify installation by typing `git –version` in the command line
_Note: I like cmder for my command line to make it a little easier on the eyes https://cmder.net/)_
* Create a local folder for the project and convert it to a git repo:
  * cd C:/repos/my-new-folder
  * git init
* Create the repo in remote and follow directions to clone into your folder
* Example - BitBucket instructions:
  * Configure Git for the first time
    * git config --global user.name "Fname Lname"
    * git config --global user.email "myemail@paylocity.com"
    * git init
    * git clone https://path@to/code/repo/from/bitbucket.git
    * git status
    * git add --all
    * git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    * git remote add origin https://path@to/code/repo/from/bitbucket.git
    * git push -u origin master
  * To push existing code to an empty repo
    * cd existing-project
    * git remote set-url origin https://path@to/code/repo/from/bitbucket.git
    * git push -u origin master
  * Branching
    * NOTE: There must be an initial commit before 'master' is created and/or a branch can be created
    * List all branches in repo: `git branch`
    * Create a new branch and switch to it: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
    * Switch to an existing branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`
    * Delete unused feature branch locally: `git branch -d <branch-name>`
  * Working with other people's code
    * Update branch: `git pull`
    * Merge another branch to your active branch (e.g. latest from develop to your feature branch): `git merge <other-branch-name>`
    * View diffs for branch: `git diff`
    * View diffs for file: `git diff --base <file-name>`
    * Preview changes before merge: `git diff <source-branch> <target-branch>`
    * Press `q` to exit diff
      * NOTE: You can use Beyond Compare (or something else) to view diffs
        * Run the following (for Git v.2+ and BC v4+): 
        * `git config --global diff.tool bc`
        * `git config --global difftool.prompt false`
        * `git config --global difftool.bc.path "C:\Program Files\Beyond Compare 4\BCompare.exe"`
        * `git config --global merge.tool bc`
        * `git config --global mergetool.prompt false`
        * `git config --global mergetool.bc.path "C:\Program Files\Beyond Compare 4\BCompare.exe"`
      * To view the diff, run: `git difftool --<filename>`
      * To view a preview a merge/resolve conflicts, run: `git mergetool`
      * Note that you won't be able to continue in the command line until you close Beyond Compare
  * Fixing unwanted changes
    * View recent commits: `git log`
    * Revert local changes to a previous commit:
      * `git fetch origin`
      * `git reset --hard origin/master`
    * Replace local changes with the most recent in remote: `git checkout -- <file-name>`
  * Rename or Move a File
    * _NOTE: Do NOT move or rename a file from Windows Explorer and commit it. Git views this as a deletion of the original and creation of a new file, and the file history will be disconnected. Follow the below instructions or refer to the linked article below for help._
    * _NOTE: Although moving and renaming a file may seem like separate operations/subjects, Git treats them as the same operation, as you are modifying the path of a file either way._
  * To rename a file, in the command line:
    * `cd <parent-folder-of-existing-file>`
    * `git mv <existing-file-name> <new-file-name>`
    * `git add --all`
    * `git commit -m "<issue #>: Renamed <existing> to <new>"`
    * `git push`
  * To move a file, in the command line:
    * `cd <parent-folder-of-existing-file>`
    * `git mv <existing-file-name> <path-to-new-parent-directory>`
    * `git add --all`
    * `git commit -m "<issue #>: Moved <file-name> to <new-folder-name>"`
    * `git push`
